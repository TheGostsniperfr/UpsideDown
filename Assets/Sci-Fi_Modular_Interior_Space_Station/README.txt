Thank you for purchasing this product, I hope you will make great games with it ;)

Aside from 3D assets, this package contains a few simple scripts (DoorMovement, TriggerToOpen, TriggerToClose) whose only purpose is to make Demo Scene playable by allowing Player to walk through the doors.
They might not be very sophisticated but you can use them in your projects as well.
There is an custom shader called "ColorCustomPBR" which is very simillar to HDRP "Lit" shader but with option to customize color based on alpha channel of an albedo texture.
